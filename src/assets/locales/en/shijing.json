                    "note": "&lt;p&gt;These hymns are part of the third book of poetry. While the small hymns are mostly critical, this large hymn is a song of praise, especially for King Wen. This poem is narrative in nature. Praising and glorifying King Wen while alive and after his death. King Wen is recognized as the founder of the Zhou dynasty, the father of King Wu (Ji Fa) who succeeded in overthrowing the Shang/Yin dynasty which at that time was ruled by King Zhou Wang/Yin Shou as the last king whose behavior was very arbitrary. The holiness and glory of King Wen is expressed in this poem, after he died he remained alive and appeared in the sky on the right and left side of Tian/Shang Di and received the respect of his children and grandchildren. He had ten children, King Wu was the second son, his first son died in helping his father who was exiled by King Zhou Wang (Tiu Ong) in the land of You Li. Wu Wang as the second son was the one who succeeded in overthrowing the Shang Dynasty and establishing the Zhou dynasty in 1122 BC; and Ji Dan / Prophet Zhou Gong was the fourth son who became the last great prophet of Ru Jiao (Confucian religion) before the prophet Kongzi&lt;/p&gt;"
